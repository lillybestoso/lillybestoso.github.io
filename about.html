    <h1>All About Me!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the About Me page! Here I will tell you a little bit about myself so you can get to know me. <br>
        My name is Lilly Bestoso and I was born and raised in Newport, Rhode Island. I grew up with my brother, <br>
        mom, and dad as a very close knit family. I was a three sport varsity athlete in High School, playing <br>
        soccer, basketball, and softball. I graduated in 2020 in the top 10 of my class. I am currently attending <br>
        the university of Rhode Island, anticipating to graduate this upcoming December with a bachelor's degree <br>
        in Communication Studies. While in school, I also manage a job at the Newport Police Department as the <br>
        Traffic Aide Coordinator. I am in charge of up to 24 Traffic Aides who go around the City of Newport and <br>
        give our parking tickets. I am responsible for making sure all of the equipment funcitoins properly, ordering <br>
        supplies, and answering any questions they have while on the road. I also hold an office component to the job. <br>
        I have the authority the accept or decline any citation reviews that come in online, in the mail, over the <br>
        phone, and in person. It is up to my discretion whether or not the ticket should be voided. Aside from working <br>
        at the NPD, I also hold a receptionist position at a medical spa in newport, Radiant Esthetics, as well as <br>
        babysitting for families on the weeknights and weekends. In my free time I am working out, running, hanging <br>
        out with friends and traveling. I am planning to go to the Municipal Police Academy for the South Kingstown <br>
        Police Department this coming January. My training is key to being successful in the academy, which is something <br>
        I have been focusing on tremendously. I am excited to enhance my knowledge in computer science and technological <br>
        content.  </p>
