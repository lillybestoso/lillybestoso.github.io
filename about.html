    <h1>All About Me!</h1>
    <div class="my-div">
        <p>Welcome to the About Me page! Here I will tell you a little bit about myself so you can get to know me.
        My name is Lilly Bestoso and I was born and raised in Newport, Rhode Island. I grew up with my brother,
        mom, and dad as a very close knit family. I was a three sport varsity athlete in High School, playing
        soccer, basketball, and softball. I graduated in 2020 in the top 10 of my class. I am currently attending
        the university of Rhode Island, anticipating to graduate this upcoming December with a bachelor's degree
        in Communication Studies. While in school, I also manage a job at the Newport Police Department as the
        Traffic Aide Coordinator. I am in charge of up to 24 Traffic Aides who go around the City of Newport and
        give our parking tickets. I am responsible for making sure all of the equipment funcitoins properly, ordering
        supplies, and answering any questions they have while on the road. I also hold an office component to the job.
        I have the authority the accept or decline any citation reviews that come in online, in the mail, over the
        phone, and in person. It is up to my discretion whether or not the ticket should be voided. Aside from working
        at the NPD, I also hold a receptionist position at a medical spa in newport, Radiant Esthetics, as well as
        babysitting for families on the weeknights and weekends. In my free time I am working out, running, hanging
        out with friends and traveling. I am planning to go to the Municipal Police Academy for the South Kingstown
        Police Department this coming January. My training is key to being successful in the academy, which is something
        I have been focusing on tremendously. I am excited to enhance my knowledge in computer science and technological
        content.</p>
